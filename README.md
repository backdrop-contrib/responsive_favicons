# Responsive Favicons


This module adds the favicons generated by
[RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net) to your site. The
responsive name comes from the fact that many devices are catered for including
iPhone, Android, iPad, other tablets and desktops.

## Requirements
- Favicon files generated by https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- HTML code generated by https://realfavicongenerator.net/

## Installation

1. Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
https://docs.backdropcms.org/documentation/extend-with-modules.
2. Prepare your icon file, either an SVG or a PNG, with a square icon with
minimum size of 512x512px.
3. Go to https://realfavicongenerator.net/ and upload your icon.
4. Adjust the settings for each icon type to your preference.
5. When asked for the 'Favicon path' leave it as '/' (the root of your
website); this is because this modules will rewrite the URLs based on the
Backdrop public file system path and your preferences in the module.
6. Click to 'Download your favicon package'.
7. Copy the HTML code section to your clipboard; it is a good idea to save this
to a text file and keep with the zip file.
8. Visit Administration > Configuration > User interface > Responsive favicons
(/admin/config/user-interface/responsive_favicons), paste in the HTML you
copied and upload the zip file you downloaded.

You site will now output the required metadata for the favicons to work. You can
always check the status report page to find out if your site has been correctly
configured.

### Advanced installation
Despite the headers saying where to find the files, some clients will look for
these at the root. This module can intercept these requests for files that are
managed by this module (this varies over time as client systems change).

However, the default Backdrop `.htaccess` file at the Backdrop root prevents
this for the `favicon.ico` file. To enable this module to serve the
`favicon.ico` file from the defined location you need to comment out the
following line:

```apacheconf
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !=/favicon.ico
```

so it looks like this:

```apacheconf
# RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !=/favicon.ico
```
